### Importance of Identifying Design Properties
Understanding the design properties of a mockup is critical for several reasons:
1. **Consistency**: Ensures that the final product aligns with the visual identity and design language of the application.
2. **Collaboration**: Provides a common reference point for designers, developers, and stakeholders.
3. **Efficiency**: Speeds up the development process by reducing the need for guesswork.
4. **Accessibility**: Helps maintain readability and usability across different platforms and devices.

By clearly defining color styles, typography, and other design elements, we can maintain a cohesive and user-friendly design throughout the project.
